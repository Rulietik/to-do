# Solar Batteries Project

This is a website made to help distinguishing the optimal angle for installing solar batteries at the coordinates given by the user. In addition we will consider side factors, such as: weather in the given region, temperature etc. Based on this outcome it will calculate the approximate energy otcome in kWh(or just kW) and the storage device capacity needed to stre the abundant energy.
